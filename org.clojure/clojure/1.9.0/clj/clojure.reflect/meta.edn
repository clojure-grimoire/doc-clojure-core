{:author "Stuart Halloway", :added "1.3", :doc "Reflection on Host Types\nAlpha - subject to change.\n\nTwo main entry points: \n\n* type-reflect reflects on something that implements TypeReference.\n* reflect (for REPL use) reflects on the class of an instance, or\n  on a class if passed a class\n\nKey features:\n\n* Exposes the read side of reflection as pure data. Reflecting\n  on a type returns a map with keys :bases, :flags, and :members.\n\n* Canonicalizes class names as Clojure symbols. Types can extend\n  to the TypeReference protocol to indicate that they can be\n  unambiguously resolved as a type name. The canonical format\n  requires one non-Java-ish convention: array brackets are <>\n  instead of [] so they can be part of a Clojure symbol.\n\n* Pluggable Reflectors for different implementations. The default\n  JavaReflector is good when you have a class in hand, or use\n  the AsmReflector for \"hands off\" reflection without forcing\n  classes to load.\n\nPlatform implementers must:\n\n* Create an implementation of Reflector.\n* Create one or more implementations of TypeReference.\n* def default-reflector to be an instance that satisfies Reflector."}
