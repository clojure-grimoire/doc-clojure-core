{:doc "clojure.test extension for JUnit-compatible XML output.\n\n  JUnit (http://junit.org/) is the most popular unit-testing library\n  for Java.  As such, tool support for JUnit output formats is\n  common.  By producing compatible output from tests, this tool\n  support can be exploited.\n\n  To use, wrap any calls to clojure.test/run-tests in the\n  with-junit-output macro, like this:\n\n    (use 'clojure.test)\n    (use 'clojure.test.junit)\n\n    (with-junit-output\n      (run-tests 'my.cool.library))\n\n  To write the output to a file, rebind clojure.test/*test-out* to\n  your own PrintWriter (perhaps opened using\n  clojure.java.io/writer).", :author "Jason Sankey"}
